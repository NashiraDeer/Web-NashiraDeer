# Nashira Deer // Home

Hello, my name is Deyvid da Silva Costa, I've been born in Brazil in the year of 2005 and at a early age I've had an interest in the computer area. With 12 years old, I have changed the operating system of my mother's notebook from 32-bit to a 64-bit version and I didn't take too long to start learning programming, begging in 2019, with only an Android smartphone and NodeJS on Termux. Since then, I've always tried to learn more and keeping always improving my skills.

## About my work

When I start a new project, I search and learn the best way to develop it, keeping in mind, that it needs be efficient, functional and optimized, even after the release, because I know that a software isn't only a source code or a binary file, it's a tool that gonna be used by another people, another people that trust in me to help him, that's why I need to be responsible and open for critics.

## What is Deer Software?

Deer Software is only a commercial name of Nashira Deer, that are my pseudonym.
